Repo by: Matt Moughan, started on 2/11/2015

Understanding and Practicing the Box Model.
Specifically want to understand the following:
- Margin representation of an element and relationship to other elements
- Padding within an element and overall calculation of width/height of an element
- Border --> width, style, and color
- Total Width of an Element!
- Also practicing inheritence, selector types, and working with fonts

Practice through creating various elements within a simple html document, then manipulating the elements on the page using all of the above.
